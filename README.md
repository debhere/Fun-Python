You want to create a fun story with your own characters. In this project, you're supposed to get inputs for 2 nouns, their 2 verbs and maybe one adjective associated with one of the nouns. Now, think of a small storyline where both characters (nouns) are conversing on a topic and you need to output the formatted text of the story with the inputted nouns, verbs, and adjective.
