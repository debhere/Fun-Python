This repo contains fun python projects segregated by difficulty levels. It's a good way to practice and implement Python logic in a fun way which eventually increases our confidence level.

## starters

This directory contains projects for absolute beginners in Python. Each project has its dedicate folders for seamless access

### 1. mad libs

You want to create a fun story with your own characters. In this project, you're supposed to get inputs for 2 nouns, their 2 verbs and maybe one adjective associated with one of the nouns. Now, think of a small storyline where both characters (nouns) are conversing on a topic and you need to output the formatted text of the story with the inputted nouns, verbs, and adjective.

### 2. number guessing

It is a simple game where user is supposed to guess the number. The number is selected at random within a range and then the user is asked to guess the number, accordingly prompted if the user's guess in lesser or greater than the number.

### 3. dice simulator

A pure dice simulator. User can select how many dice she wants to roll and our simulator will generate the result with it's total value.

### 4. hangman

This is the implementation of an old yet popular game of hangman where user is asked to guess the letter of an word. Few wrong guesses are allowed.

### 5. Rock-Paper-Scissors

Probably one of the best games ever. This is the python implementation.
